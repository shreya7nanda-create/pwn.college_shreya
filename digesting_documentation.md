**Flag:** pwn.college{85aIYWS495KquG46t6trGu9ClX9.QX0ITO0wiNxEzNzEzW}

must pass argument properly to the command (/challenge/challenge) to generate the flag.
```
#!/bin/bash

example triple ticks for bash

pwn.college{helloworld}
```

## What I learned

i learned how to properly pass argument to a command

# Learning complex usage

### when the arguments to commands are more complex

**Flag:** pwn.college{46ekbhCUy7vBnzr9pk5oTlEFWOK.QX1ITO0wiNxEzNzEzW}

 sometimes, arguments to certain commands can even be a programming language.
 
 here, we must mention the *proper argument to the argument* to obtain flag.
 
 ** i initially went wrong wid finiding the flag file.
 give path to flag as / if file not mentioned.

```
#!/bin/bash

example triple ticks for bash

pwn.college{helloworld}
```

explain your solve and how you got to it, explain any incorrect tangents you went on while solving.

to put code snippets, put three backticks and for images and all other stuff you wish to put here, refer to the documentation given to you.

don't style it too much, your solve should be readable and understandable by you so that when you have doubts, you refer to your own writeups, instead of gpt.

```
#!/bin/bash
