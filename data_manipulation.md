explain your solve and how you got to it, explain any incorrect tangents you went on while solving.

to put code snippets, put three backticks and for images and all other stuff you wish to put here, refer to the documentation given to you.

don't style it too much, your solve should be readable and understandable by you so that when you have doubts, you refer to your own writeups, instead of gpt.
